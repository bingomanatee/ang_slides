ang_slides
==========

A self contained slideshow managed through Angular. 

This is a slideshow with remote pages; the CSS is based on Twitter Bootsrap. 

The slideshow is currently a presentation I am putting together for Nuby-Express.

To change the content of the slide show, change the content folder and the slides collection in js/collection.js.
